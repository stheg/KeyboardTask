# KeyboardTask

A simple virtual keyboard.

The challenge was:
* Focus should remain on the input field when the user interface buttons are pressed.
* Caret must remain in last position.
* Pressing UI button when the text is selected should replace it with corresponding character.
  Selection should dissapear, the caret should move to the position after this symbol.
* Backspace, Left and Right buttons should be implemented. Left and Right buttons should move the cursor over the input field.
* Virtual keyboard must be consistent and should not interfere with manual input from a real keyboard,
* The bonus is to implement multiple keystrokes on the button hold, as on a real keyboard.
